      <item value="The {@code String} class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as {@code &quot;abc&quot;}, are implemented as instances of this class. &lt;p&gt; Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt; String str = &quot;abc&quot;; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; is equivalent to: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt; char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'}; String str = new String(data); &lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some more examples of how strings can be used: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt; System.out.println(&quot;abc&quot;); String cde = &quot;cde&quot;; System.out.println(&quot;abc&quot; + cde); String c = &quot;abc&quot;.substring(2,3); String d = cde.substring(1, 2); &lt;pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; The class {@code String} includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the {@link java.lang.Character Character} class. &lt;p&gt; The Java language provides special support for the string concatenation operator (&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;), and for conversion of other objects to strings. String concatenation is implemented through the {@code StringBuilder}(or {@code StringBuffer}) class and its {@code append} method. String conversions are implemented through the method {@code toString}, defined by {@code Object} and inherited by all classes in Java. For additional information on string concatenation and conversion, see Gosling, Joy, and Steele, &lt;i&gt;The Java Language Specification&lt;i&gt;. &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise noted, passing a &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;tt&gt; argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown. &lt;p&gt;A {@code String} represents a string in the UTF-16 format in which &lt;em&gt;supplementary characters&lt;em&gt; are represented by &lt;em&gt;surrogate pairs&lt;em&gt; (see the section &lt;a href=&quot;Character.htmlunicode&quot;&gt;Unicode Character Representations&lt;a&gt; in the {@code Character} class for more information). Index values refer to {@code char} code units, so a supplementary character uses two positions in a {@code String}. &lt;p&gt;The {@code String} class provides methods for dealing with Unicode code points (i.e., characters), in addition to those for dealing with Unicode code units (i.e., {@code char} values)." />
